# ðŸ§  AI Task Scheduler

**AI Task Scheduler** is a personal productivity web application that allows users to schedule and manage tasks using natural language. The app leverages OpenAI's GPT model to extract structured task information from free-text input and automatically adds these tasks to a local database and Google Calendar.

## ðŸ’¡ Key Features

- **Natural Language Input**: Enter tasks like "Submit the report by Friday at 2 PM, high priority, 45 minutes" and the app understands and schedules them.
- **Google Calendar Integration**: Each task is added as a calendar event, including title, time, and description.
- **Reminders**: The app checks tasks every minute and alerts the user if any are due within 15 minutes.
- **Web-Based Interface**: Users interact through a simple, clean Flask-powered web UI.
- **Task Management**: Tasks are stored in an SQLite database with options to view and delete them.
